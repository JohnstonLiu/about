            <h1>Why do Students Procrastinate? How do You Stop It?</h1>
            <p>
                Time management is a problem that most people will have faced at least once in their lifetime. In most
                cases, time management issues begin to rise during one's high school years. Where students would
                previously lead a carefree life, once academics are starting to be taken more seriously and workloads
                increase, time management will be essential to their success. However, this is where most students will
                suffer.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>The Root Cause</h2>

            <p>
                Procrastination can be defined as "the action of delaying or postponing something". Now using this
                definition we can realize that in theory we would only delay things if they were unenjoyable. Now we can
                either make this work enjoyable or we can help ourselves realize the importance of this work. In order
                to make the work enjoyable you can treat it like a game. Whenever you finish a task, give yourself a
                reward. However, make sure that your reward is NOT distraction. It can be a snack, working on a personal
                project, or a hobby just for a few minutes before you get back to work. And before you know it, once you
                have completed all your task, you will feel this immense ammount of satisfaction. For once, your to do
                list is finally empty. However, if it is simply impossible for you to make the work enjoyable, then we
                must treat them as <b>Gravity Problems.</b>
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Gravity Problems</h2>

            <p>
                In this <a href="https://youtu.be/SemHh0n19LA?t=465" style="color: red">Ted Talk</a> Bill Burnett
                introduces the concept of Gravity Problems and how you can deal with them. To put it simply,
                Gravity Problems are problems that we cannot combat. They are a circumstance that we are in and a
                circumstance that we must accept. For example, say you really hate learning a certain course. The topic
                is bland and you feel as if you are just wasting time on it.
                Well you know what, you will just have to deal with it. You will have to acknowledge it as a Gravity
                Problem and accept that it will just be a way of life. Just like brushing your teeth every morning or
                dealing with an annoying teacher there is nothing you can do about it and there is nothing you should
                do. Nevertheless, there are problems that are not Gravity Problems and they can be combatted.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Social Media</h2>

            <p>
                With most cases of procrastination, the main perpetrator can be linked to social media. Either your
                friend is messaging you or there is this new video on YouTube that you must watch, these urges are what
                you need to break. A simple way is to turn off notiffications. I cannot stress how simple yet effective
                this is. However, that may not be enough. Say you completed an hour of your studies and you decided to
                take a
                break. You instinctively grab your phone and hop onto social media. Where you previously stated that it
                would only be five minutes, the enjoyment that social media provides is too much to give up. The five
                minutes turn into ten minutes, then to thirty minutes, until you reach an hour. You suddenly check the
                time only to see you have wasted an hour and not realized it. Now it is time to start breaking your
                habits.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Breaking Habits</h2>

            <p>
                In order to stop social media from controlling your life. You first need to take control. There are many
                ways to approach this and I will list a few effective ones. Everytime you pick up your phone, ask
                yourself "How will this benefit my future?" If that does not work, you can be physical about it and
                place your phone away out of convenience to where you work. This way whenever you instinctively reach
                for your phone, you realize that it is not there and that you placed it far away in order to combat your
                procrastination. Which reminds you that you should be getting to work. However, if your distraction is
                not just your phone but rather all forms of technology, there is still a way. Any work that can be
                completed without technology should be done away from technology. Move away from your desk and move to
                the kitchen, or you could even go outside. However if technology is required for your work, you can
                apply the same principle by asking yourself "How will this benefit my future?" whenever you click on a
                distraction. If self-motivation is not enough, there is once again a brute force option. A free desktop
                app
                called <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/" style="color: red">"Cold Turkey"</a> can block distracting
                websites with no way for you to disable it. Uninstalling, ending with Task Manager, Force Quiting, etc
                has no effect. However, if you are unable to implement the methods mentioned previously,
                there is still hope.
            </p>

            <h2>Exceptions</h2>

            <p>
                If you keep forgetting to ask yourself "How will this benefit my future?" everytime
                you get distracted, have a poster in your workspace or a wallpaper on your computer or phone or
                something to remind you. If you are unable to place your phone at an inconvenience to you, shut down
                your phone once you get to work. That way whenever you try to use your phone, you have to think before
                turning it on to which you will remember to ask yourself, "How will this benefit my future?". Another
                method is to move around all social media icons on your phone frequently. This way whenever you are
                searching for your distraction, you will once again remember, "How will this benefit my future?".
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

            <p>
                Students procrastinate because they do not enjoy their work. To combat this we can either make the work
                enjoyable or treat it as a Gravity Problem. We must learn to accept Gravity Problems as a way of life
                and to simply deal with it. Social media is another problem that we face but it is not a Gravity
                Problem. We can combat social media by breaking our habits through self-motivation and if needed brute
                force. Hopefully this discussion can help you understand why students procrastinate and how
                procrastination can be combatted.
