            <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
            <p>
                This site was created with the intention of sharing My Thoughts hence the name, surrounding certain
                topics that I find interesting/worthy of discussion. Thus, unfortunately this website will not have a
                consistent schedule. If I were to enforce a consistent schedule I doubt that my posts would be of any
                quality.
            </p>

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a student who has some free time. I did not want to waste the free time that I had so I decided to make something of it. Using this site, I hope that I can impact your life positively.
            </p>

            <h2>Other Projects</h2>
            <p>
                You may have noticed in the nav bar of the site that there is a link called "myGames". On that site will be games that I have made available for free. Obviously, these games are not meant to distract you from your work but simply as a way to take a break from your usual busy life. Prioritize and make sure work comes first.
