                This site was created with the intention of sharing My Thoughts hence the name, surrounding certain
                topics that I find interesting/worthy of discussion. Thus, unfortunately this website will not have a
                consistent schedule. If I were to enforce a consistent schedule I doubt that my posts would be of any
                quality.
